title: Today's notes
---

* I don't understand this feeling of being told what media to consume (especially books) on the basis of it being "problematic". You're a full formed adult and no one can tell you what to read. Read whatever you want: mysoginists, antisemites, TERFs, idiots. You can still be your own damn self.

* I'm glad Americans are finally confronting what the rest of the world knows: anyone can be president. 

* Reading Hanna Arendt saves me temporarily from the oversimplified manichaeism of Twitter politics. It's like taking a dip in a pool of doubt, nuance, historical questions, context and analysis. Refreshing!

* Today's reading: Lies. [http://www.liesjournal.net/](http://www.liesjournal.net/) I started reading this piece [Caring, A Labor of Stolen Time](http://www.liesjournal.net/volume1-06-caring.html)
