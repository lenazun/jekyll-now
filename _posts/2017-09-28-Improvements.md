The hardest thing to do is to be the dependable person. To be that somebody who says they'll show up and then do.  I've been working on this for years and still have to improve so much. I'm enthusiastic and prone to fall in love with the abstract concept of things. I say yes to everything and then the day comes, and I'm sad, or anxious or tired, and I don't want to go. I don't want to do it, but I do anyway.  I most of the time enjoy whatever there is to be enjoyed, I engage, I work and help and try to contribute. If I have no other special talents, I want to be dependable and present, because being there counts.
