I've spent a few weeks away from Twitter, not posting, and for the most part, not reading. 

* I have ADHD, and I need to avoid distraction while also struggling with not getting hyper-focused on stupid shit. A balancing act that is in practice impossible, given that I'm a PM and I manage an open-ended list of projects with varying degrees of definition. I'm a water juggler. My job is to have my literal and figurative doors open to questions, status checks, new inquiries and incoming tickets. Being distracted is my job, in a certain way. Maybe I shouldn't get distracted for free.

* The world is ending. There's nothing I can do to stop feeling like the world is ending. I don't need to know about the president's latest dumb shit. I don't want to re-live my trauma or other people's horrifying abuse experiences. I can't deal with devastating fires in Kansas or drowning puppies in Lisbon every ten minutes.  If the world is going to end, I'll be happy to find out approximately at the same time than Lamont, the man who camps outside our office with a small installation of stuffed animals, receiving the occasional dollar with a smile.

* I miss my friends. They are smart and funny, and their lives are interesting to me. I want to see their dogs, their freshly baked loafs of bread, their babies eating cake, their kids being incredible nerds, their DSA chapters winning elections and their massive brains inventing new tech. I care about their opinions, and I'm sadly missing that very much. Individually messaging them is harder than just reading their silly tweets. Sigh. 

* With my newfound free time I write like crazy, mostly in Spanish. I read actual books. I watch TV. All of this somehow keeping my opinions to myself. I tweet in my mind, and then let it go into nothingness.
